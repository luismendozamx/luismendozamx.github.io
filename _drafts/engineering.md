Culture matters. It matters in every sphere of our social interactions. It is also _widely_ different in each of these social environments.

I'm no scientist, nor will I pretend to be one in this post. What I want to talk about is *engineering culture*, something I've had the pleasure of dealing with in diverse environments.

In the past, I've worked as some form of developer or engineer (not the same thing, titles are an important part of culture) at an agency, freelancing, failing at launching a startup (twice), two startups and a big financial institution. I've focused mostly on product development, that is, building applications to sell some kind of service/good, or paid for in a Software As a Service model. In every single one of these experiences I've learned that engineering culture is one of the hardest things to get right when running a company that sells or uses technology as part of their core business.

So, how can we define engineering culture? What aspects should it cover? And more importantly, what impact can it have on your organization and it's business outcomes? 'Cause at the end of the day, we are all trying to make money out of of this, right?

### Every company is a technology company...

I like to agree when people say this. But that doesn't mean every company should approach technology the same way. If what you do involves hiring "programmers" as full-time employees and having them write code that will be used as part of your core business, then you should definitely be thinking about building the right engineering culture.

### What is engineering culture?
