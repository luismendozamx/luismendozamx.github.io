Hi! My name is Luis Enrique Mendoza.

I'm a software engineer and photographer based in Mexico City.

I study Computer Engineering at [ITAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Tecnol%C3%B3gico_Aut%C3%B3nomo_de_M%C3%A9xico){:target="blank"}, I'm currently working on my thesis that focuses on the design and adoption of microservices for building large scale cloud-native applications. 

I work at ([GBM](http://gbm.com.mx/){:target="blank"}), Mexico's leading brokerage firm, where I'm the technical lead for a [new investment product](https://investify.mx){:target="blank"}. I've built and designed the core architecture and systems of our application using technologies like Node.js, MongoDB, Redis, React.js, Ember.js, Docker, DC/OS, Mesos, etc.

In the past I worked at a [couple](https://www.mercadoni.com.mx) [startups](http://yabit.io/) and a few projects using technologies like Rails, PostgreSQL, Ember.js, Angular.js...

On the weekends I enjoy taking photographs and I occasionally do professional wedding photography with [Se Toman Fotos](http://setomanfotos.com){:target="blank"}.
