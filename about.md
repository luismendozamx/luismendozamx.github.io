Hi! My name is Luis Enrique Mendoza.

I'm a software engineer and photographer based in Mexico City.

I study Computer Engineering at [ITAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Tecnol%C3%B3gico_Aut%C3%B3nomo_de_M%C3%A9xico){:target="blank"} and work as a front-end web developer at [Mercadoni](https://mercadoni.com.mx){:target="blank"}. I also do professional wedding photography with [Se Toman Fotos](http://setomanfotos.com){:target="blank"}.
